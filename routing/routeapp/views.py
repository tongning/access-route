    The bulk of the work is performed in this function, which runs once the user enters a start and end address
    and clicks Submit. In a nutshell, here's what it does:
    1. Retrieve the start and end address that the user submitted using HTTP GET
    2. Query the OpenCage Geocoding API to find the coordinates corresponding to the start and end addresses
    3. Find the start segment, the sidewalk edge closest to the start coordinates. Also find the end segment, the
       sidewalk edge closest to the end coordinates
    4. Split the start segment at the start coordinates, creating two shorter edges. Repeat for end segment.
    5. Create a temporary table containing the four shorter edges in addition to the rest of the sidewalk segments
    6. Run a PgRouting query on the temporary table to find the shortest accessible route. The PgRouting query returns
       the route as a Geojson string.
    7. Query for elevation data at various points along the route and generate a Geojson string that contains both
       the route and the elevation data.
    8. Render an HTML page, inserting the generated Geojson into the page.

    Path sorting algorithm description:
    - Parse the json from PostGIS into a list named 'data'. The 'data' list is nested: It is a list of paths,
      each path is a list of points, and each point is a list containing lat and lng. So 'data' looks like this:
      [
      [ [5,6][7,8] ]
      [ [9,10][11,12][13,14] ]
      ]
    - Create an empty list 'data_ordered'. It will have the same structure as the 'data' list, but of course
      it will store the paths in order.
    - Remove a path from 'data' and put it into data_ordered
    - Find the lat/lng coordinates of the LAST point in this path
    - Search through 'data' for a path that either begins or ends at the coordinates found in the last step. This is
      the path that goes next, so append it to data_ordered and remove it from 'data'. If needed, reverse the order of
      the points in the newly appended path so that the common coordinates "meet". For instance, if the original path
      is [ [6,7][12,14][3,6] ] and the new path to append is [ [3,8][3,4][3,6] ], here's what data_ordered should look
      like after this step:
      [
      [ [6,7][12,14][3,6] ]
      [ [3,6][3,4][3,8] ]
      ]
    - Keep repeating this until no new path to append is found, at which point we have reached the end of the route.
      Now do this again, but prepending paths that should go before the first path currently in 'data_ordered'
      (rather than appending paths that go after the last one). The process continues until the 'data' list contains
      no more paths.
